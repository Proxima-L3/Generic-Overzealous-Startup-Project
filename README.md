<h1 align="center">Generic Overzealous Startup Project</h1>



<h2>Description:</h2>

A website for a comedically generic and overzealous startup with extremely ambiguous intentions. Meant to be a mini project aimed at learning Bootstrap 5 via documentation, in an entertaining and satirical manner.


<h2>Goals/Purpose:</h2>

- Learn bootstrap via documentation.
- Learn some basic html/css/web development standard practices.


<h3>Note:</h3>

- Another repo (HTML-CSS-Review) was meant to serve the purpose of reviewing the basics of html, css, 
and bootstrap. However, I realized the videos I was using to review bootstrap, were extremely outdated. 
I decided it would be a good opportunity to, in another repo (this one), practice referencing/learning 
from documentation only what I need instead of the very common learning method of watching videos 
and reading articles "cover to cover" before actually making anything.
