<h1 align="center">Generic Overzealous Startup Project</h1>



<h2>Description:</h2>

A website for a comedically generic and overzealous startup with extremely ambiguous intentions. Meant to be a mini project aimed at learning Bootstrap 5 via documentation, in an entertaining and satirical manner.


<h2>Goals/Purpose:</h2>

- Learn bootstrap via documentation.
- Learn some basic html/css/web development standard practices.
- Learn about and how to implement commonly used front-end web development widgets/concepts (navbars, footers, cdns, grid systems, responsive web design, etc)


<h3>Note:</h3>

- Another repo (HTML-CSS-Review) was meant to serve the purpose of reviewing the basics of html, css, 
and bootstrap. However, I realized the videos I was using to review bootstrap, were extremely outdated. 
I decided it would be a good opportunity to, in another repo (this one), practice referencing/learning 
from documentation only what I need instead of the very common learning method of watching videos 
and reading articles "cover to cover" before actually making anything.
- The original intention of this repo was to gain familiarity with bootstrap 5 features and to see if 
I could effectively learn by exclusively using documentation. But after gaining confidence in my 
ability to learn via documentation, I decided to use the MVP (minimum viable product) approach with 
this project; instead of creating a website with all the bootstrap features and concepts initially 
planned, I will make a basic version of the project with most of the content and pages decided upon 
and very minimal implemented features.
    - This decision was made to save time and pursue other projects; specifically a very basic 
    javascript oop console program (see Library-Management-System-Project repo), in which the 
    main purposes/goals will be to attempt to learn javascript, primarily through documentation, 
    and to check my understanding of oop (other goals/purposes will be decided upon later).
    - Also note: this project is not abandoned, it is simply being placed on the back burner. 
    Most features will remain in the backlog, only occasionally being worked on while attending 
    to other projects.
