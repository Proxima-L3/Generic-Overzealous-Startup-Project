(WIP)
- _wip-loc_
- decide on a project to make (keeping in mind key concepts in bootstrap to implement... maybe explore 
documentation to decide what other features site/project should include)
- make sketches of site/mini project and a list of all desired features in notebook


(backlog)
- make wire frames or mockups with figma (if it seems like it will take too long to learn figma, 
just skip this step and use sketches in notebook)
  - make room for figma on hard drive
  - download figma
  - learn basics of figma
  - make wireframes/mockups
- find way to implement following concepts in the bootstrap 5 project (use documentation to learn 
just what is needed, when it is needed - "learning on the fly")
    - review grid system (row classes, screen size and col number modifier classes, break points, etc)
    - containers
    - jumbotrons
    - buttons
    - background color
    - forms (group, control, etc)
    - navbars (with nav, div, a, ul, li elements... or look at documentation.. use w3 schools?..)
    - collapse/hamburger icon
    - connecting jquery cdn (to make bootstrap classes interactive)
