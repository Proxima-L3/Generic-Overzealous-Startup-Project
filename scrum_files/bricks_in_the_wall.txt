(done)

documentation to decide what other features site/project should include)
- make generic startup logo and full screen image in illustrator
- convert logo png to needed favicons/images
- add tab and device favicon links to head tag of main index.html file
- make sketches of site/mini project and a list of all desired features in notebook (maybe save figma for next project)
    - find way to implement following concepts in the bootstrap 5 project (use documentation to learn 
    just what is needed, when it is needed - "learning on the fly")
        - background color
        - containers
        - glyphicons
        - navbars (with nav, div, a, ul, li elements... or look at documentation.. use w3 schools?..)

(backlog)
- make homepage/landing page
    - "jumbotron" (maybe)
        - startup name/logo (maybe with gradient background in jumbotron section)
        - "break" in page
        - company overview/welcome statement
        - "break" in page/end of jumbotron
    - several more sections ...each section includes:
        - (each section is supposed to be a super generic "feature"/"descriptor" of the startup.. what its "all about" WITHOUT being forward...)
        - heading/"hook statement"
        - summary under it in regular font.. supposed to be "markety"
        - breaks after each extra section

- make blog page
    - sorry, blog machine broke (maybe use pagination for a bunch of empty pages... secrets of the universe?)

- make about page (content specifics can wait or be decided when page is created... remember, this project's purpose is supposed to be about learning the basic front end web dev tools and bootstrap features, not creating a full fledged product, hence the satire)
    - ...make sure to add: ...
    - very forward over confident "mission statement" and description of "what we are all about"
    - carousel with pictures and videos of all the happy customers (maybe short clips of yes, totally legitimate REAL customer reviews/interviews)
    - ...
    - "who we are"
        - mission
        - values
        - ethics
        - leadership
    - "our impact" (include scrollspy feature for this page)
        - economic
        - empowerment (customers (carousel), employees (what employees), small businesses, big businesses, us (the company))
        - community (education (stem in shools), the environment, your backyard (nightmare nightmare nightmare))
    - "what we do"
        - finally, a clear upfront answer... *insert the most generic brief but highly descriptive non answer*

- make contact page (keep extremely simple)
    - basic contact info
    - links to proxima contact methods
    - maybe support and sales sections
    - maybe "office location" section

- make pricing page (keep simple and use tab panes for plans section)
    - idk yet (look for example/inspiration while creating site)
    - tab panes for 4 ambiguous tiers of an ambiguous service
    - each tab pane has description of tier service, whats included, and the price (use bootstrap card feature?)

- make login page
    - get rid of all navbar contents, except for homepage button
    - empty single page
    - login form square in center of page
        - login title label
        - email label and input box (require email feature)
        - password label and input box (dots and eye icon/option to show password)
        - add "Need an account? Sign up" link and "Forgot password?" feature/link (doesn't need to fully function yet.. this project isn't meant to be a fully functioning website, it is meant to learn basic front end features/bootstrap classes)
        - include all features that make sure email and password are correct
