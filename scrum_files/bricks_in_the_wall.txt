(done)
- decide on a project to make (keeping in mind key concepts in bootstrap to implement... maybe explore 
documentation to decide what other features site/project should include)


(WIP)
- make sketches of site/mini project and a list of all desired features in notebook (maybe save figma for next project)
    - find way to implement following concepts in the bootstrap 5 project (use documentation to learn 
    just what is needed, when it is needed - "learning on the fly")
        - background color
        - containers
        - glyphicons
        - navbars (with nav, div, a, ul, li elements... or look at documentation.. use w3 schools?..)
        - collapse/hamburger icon
        - buttons (btn, btn-default/btn-success/etc, btn-lg/btn-md/etc, etc)
        - search bar
        - website footer
        - jumbotrons
        - forms (group, control, etc)
        - carousel
        - images and embedded videos
        - scrollspy feature
        - tooltips
        - navs and tabs (panes with tabs/pills... might need javascript for this)
        - cards
- _wip-loc_
        - offcanvas "notifications"
        - drop downs
        - accordion
        - modals
        - popovers
        - pagination
        - placeholders and animation of placeholders (for indicate content that is still loading)
        - button groups
        - alerts
        - progress bars
        - spinners
        - connecting jquery cdn (to make bootstrap classes interactive... bootstrap 5 doesn't use jquery?)
    - make list of needed bg & font colors for site (using information decided upon in wireframe)
- 

(backlog)
- make base features (features that are constant throughout all pages of website)
    - review grid system (row classes, screen size and col number modifier classes, break points, etc)
    - determine base features
        - choose site "color pallette" (think dark & light modes)
        - background color
        - text font/size/color
    - make navbar
        - navbar colors (background color, text font/size/color)
        - logo icon (when hovered over, animation is triggered and home icon shows up)
        - site name next to logo
        - hamburger icon that shows up when there isn't enough room for navbar contents
            - make sure 3 layer icon shows up
            - blog link
            - about link
            - contact link
            - pricing link
            - login link (login page will have link to sign up page)
        - make sure all icons/links go somewhere (add necessary blank pages/html files/folders)
        - search bar
            - search icon on far right of screen
            - actual bar (when icon is clicked, bar shows up, search icon is replaced by an x, and everything in navbar is pushed to the left.. maybe)
    - make footer
        - footer colors (background color, text font/size/color)
        - contact icon links (github, discord, youtube)
        - light/dark mode toggler icon
        - site language picker (just icon for now.. maybe machine lang..)
    - add misc and any other constant features
        - html head stuff?

- make homepage/landing page
    - "jumbotron" (maybe)
        - startup name/logo (maybe with gradient background in jumbotron section)
        - "break" in page
        - company overview/welcome statement
        - "break" in page/end of jumbotron
    - several more sections ...each section includes:
        - (each section is supposed to be a super generic "feature"/"descriptor" of the startup.. what its "all about" WITHOUT being forward...)
        - heading/"hook statement"
        - summary under it in regular font.. supposed to be "markety"
        - breaks after each extra section

- make blog page
    - sorry, blog machine broke (maybe use pagination for a bunch of empty pages... secrets of the universe?)

- make about page (content specifics can wait or be decided when page is created... remember, this project's purpose is supposed to be about learning the basic front end web dev tools and bootstrap features, not creating a full fledged product, hence the satire)
    - ...make sure to add: ...
    - very forward over confident "mission statement" and description of "what we are all about"
    - carousel with pictures and videos of all the happy customers (maybe short clips of yes, totally legitimate REAL customer reviews/interviews)
    - ...
    - "who we are"
        - mission
        - values
        - ethics
        - leadership
    - "our impact" (include scrollspy feature for this page)
        - economic
        - empowerment (customers (carousel), employees (what employees), small businesses, big businesses, us (the company))
        - community (education (stem in shools), the environment, your backyard (nightmare nightmare nightmare))
    - "what we do"
        - finally, a clear upfront answer... *insert the most generic brief but highly descriptive non answer*

- make contact page (keep extremely simple)
    - basic contact info

- make pricing page (use tab panes for plans section)
    - idk yet (look for example/inspiration?)
    - tab panes for 4 ambiguous tiers of an ambiguous service
    - each tab pane has description of tier service, whats included, and the price (use bootstrap card feature?)

- make login page
    - get rid of navbar contents except homepage button
    - empty single page/frame thing
    - login form square in center of page
        - login title label
        - email label and input box (require email feature)
        - password label and input box (dots and eye icon/option to show password)
        - add "Need an account? Sign up" link and "Forgot password?" feature/link (doesn't need to fully function yet.. this project isn't meant to be a fully functioning website, it is meant to learn basic front end features/bootstrap classes)
        - include all features that make sure email and password are correct
